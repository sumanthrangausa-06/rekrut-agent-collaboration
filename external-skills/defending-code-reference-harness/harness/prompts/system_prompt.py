"""System-prompt construction for pipeline agents.

The prompt is two layers:

  PIPELINE_PREAMBLE   — facts about the execution environment. Always true,
                       always present; not user-overridable.
  ENGAGEMENT_CONTEXT — who authorized the work and where findings go.
                       Customers override with --engagement-context <file>.

The split keeps the sandbox/isolation framing intact even when a customer
supplies a terse org-specific authorization line. build_system_prompt is
threaded to every agent (find, recon, report, grade, judge).

This agent is part of the vuln-pipeline security-research tool. The target
under test is built at a pinned commit and runs alongside this agent inside
a gVisor sandbox with no network egress beyond the API. The agent analyzes
the target, crafts inputs, and observes sanitizer output. Scope is narrow by
construction: one target, one commit, one focus area per agent, inside a
sandboxed environment.
